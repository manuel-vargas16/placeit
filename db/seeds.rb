# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
films = Film.create([
  { name: 'Star Wars', description: 'Start Wars', url_film: '', start_date: '2019-10-10', end_date: '2019-12-31' },
  { name: 'Avengers: EndGame', description: '', url_film: '', start_date: '', end_date: '' },

])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
